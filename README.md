# Movie-Recommendations
Utilizing Alternating Least Squares and Collaborative Filtering to recommend movies
I implemented and used Sparks ability to perform collaborative filtering on the specified dataset. Specifically in this case, it was the implementation of Resilient Distributed Datasets and PredictALL mapping to get the appropriate results from previous tendencies found in the data being modeled through Alternating Least Squares based collaborative filtering. The idea here is to be able to gather some hard coded information from the user as to a handful of movies that they for sure enjoy, and then have the system predict based on that (and the similar reviews of others), what that particular user will also enjoy. All that this means, is that the system uses multiple layers of trends found in similar groups of enjoyed movies to sort out a list of highly likely titles that would be rated similarly. These recommendations are then filtered down to both movies with at least 25 ratings and movies with more than 100.
